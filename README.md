This repository is aimed to save my Java programming language training code examples to assist recruiters obtain understanding what kind of programming language topics I went through already. I presume the content will be impressive soon despite its current state. :) Each folder in this directory represents a book - tutorial source for me. In some taken folder name "BookXY ..." a part "...XY..." represents a book I work on serial number. The book name and link to download it (only legal sources will be represented there, if you find some illegal action there just report that to me and I will take adequate means) is in a ReadMe file inside this book folder. Also, there are directories where its name (BookXY_Pabc) represents a book serial number "XY" and a page "abc" a topic code could be found. Each BookXY_Pabc type directory contains inside all necessary code and files for one separated project (some programming language topic) to be run on machine these files would be downloaded and compiled (speaking in general).
