This repository is aimed to save my Java programming language training code examples to assist recruiters obtain understanding what kind of programming language topics I went through already. I presume the content will be impressive soon despite its current state. :) Each file in this directory represents a book, tutorial source for me, some topic code. In some taken file name "BookXY_Pabc.java" a part "...XY..." represents a book I work on serial number. The book name and link to download it (only legal sources will be represented there, if you find some illegal action there just report that to me and I will take adequate means) is in a project description. A file name part "..._Pabc.java" represents a page "abc" in this book where a topic code could be found. Each BookXY_Pabc.java file contains all necessary Java code for one separated project (some programming language topic) to be run on machine this file would be downloaded and compiled (speaking in general). Database description could be found below.
